/**
 * OAuth redirect response when user has already consented or after consent decision.
 * Only relevant when the OAuth 2.1 server is enabled in Supabase Auth.
 *
 * This response is returned in three scenarios:
 * 1. User already consented to these scopes (auto-approved)
 * 2. User just approved the authorization request
 * 3. User just denied the authorization request
 *
 * The [redirectUrl] is a complete URL ready for redirecting the user back to the
 * OAuth client, including authorization code (on success) or error (on denial) in
 * query parameters, along with the state parameter if one was provided.
 * @param redirectUrl Complete redirect URL with authorization code and state parameters (e.g., "https://app.com/callback?code=xxx&state=yyy")
