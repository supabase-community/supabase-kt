# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to this project.

## AI

Please don't exclusively rely on AI to generate code. If using AI, double check your code. Generally I wouldn't recommend using AI for logic code.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Create a new branch
4. Make your changes \
If making changes, please make sure to follow the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html). \
4 spaces for indentation and no `*` imports should be used.
5. Submit a pull request with your new branch

The target branch for pull requests is `master`.

## How to try out the changes

You can do one of two things:
1. Run the [samples](/sample) in the repository, optionally modifying them to test your changes, but remember to revert them before submitting your pull request.
2. Publish your changes to a local Maven repository and use them in your own project. To do this, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```shell
./gradlew -DLibrariesOnly=true -DDisableSigning=true -DSupabaseVersion="customVersion" publishToMavenLocal
```
Replace `customVersion` with a unique version like `2.5.0-local-1` (to prevent version clashing with offical versions, if using the maven local repository). Then, in your project, add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}
```
And add the following to your dependencies:
```kotlin
implementation("io.github.jan-tennert.supabase:[module]:customVersion")
```
## Running Tests

It is possible to run tests across all modules using the following commands from the root directory:

```shell
# Run tests across all available targets on the platform
./gradlew allTests 

# Run tests for a specific target. They will only run if the target is supported on the platform the command is run on.
# The following targets are supported:
./gradlew jvmTest
./gradlew jsBrowserTest
./gradlew wasmJsBrowserTest
./gradlew iosX64Test
./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test
./gradlew tvosX64Test
./gradlew tvosSimulatorArm64Test
./gradlew watchosX64Test
./gradlew watchosSimulatorArm64Test
./gradlew mingwX64Test
```
Some test targets have special requirements:
- Browser tests require that Chrome, Firefox and Safari (on macOS) are installed.
- `ios`/`watchos`/`tvos` tests only work on Mac and require that the relevant SDK is installed in Xcode.
- Android does not have specific tests, but are tested implicitly through the `jvmTest` task.

### Integration Tests

The [integration-test](/integration-test) module runs the JVM client against a local Supabase stack started with the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started). It requires Docker and is skipped unless `-Pintegration` is passed:

```bash
supabase start --workdir integration-test
./script/enable-analytics.sh
export SUPABASE_URL=$(supabase status --workdir integration-test --output json | jq -r '.API_URL')
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$(supabase status --workdir integration-test --output json | jq -r '.ANON_KEY')
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=$(supabase status --workdir integration-test --output json | jq -r '.SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')
./gradlew :integration-test:test -Pintegration
supabase stop --workdir integration-test
```

- Vector bucket tests run against the local pgvector backend enabled by `[storage.vector]` in [config.toml](/integration-test/supabase/config.toml).
- Analytics (Iceberg) bucket tests need [`script/enable-analytics.sh`](/script/enable-analytics.sh). The CLI never enables the analytics bucket API locally, so the script recreates the storage container with `ICEBERG_ENABLED=true` (requires `jq`). Without it, these tests are skipped. They also run against a hosted project with analytics buckets enabled.
